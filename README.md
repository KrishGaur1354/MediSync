# MediSync

## Project Overview

MediSync is a groundbreaking website dedicated to diagnostics and the early detection of respiratory diseases, such as Emphysema or Bronchitis. Our platform empowers users to upload their medical imaging patterns, including MRIs and X-Ray scans. Leveraging advanced Machine Learning algorithms trained specifically for respiratory disease detection, we provide users with predictive insights into the likelihood of having contracted these diseases.

## Features

- **Upload Medical Images:** Users can easily upload their MRIs and X-Ray scans through our user-friendly interface.

- **Respiratory Disease Prediction:** Our state-of-the-art Machine Learning algorithm analyzes the uploaded medical images to predict the probability of early onset respiratory diseases.

- **Secure and Confidential:** We prioritize the security and confidentiality of user data. All medical information is handled with the utmost care and compliance with privacy standards.

## How it Works

1. **User Registration:** Create an account on MediSync to access the full range of features.

2. **Upload Medical Images:** Use the intuitive interface to upload your MRIs and X-Ray scans securely.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:** Our specialized Machine Learning algorithm processes the medical images to provide predictive insights.

4. **View Results:** Users can view detailed results and probabilities related to the likelihood of specific respiratory diseases.
